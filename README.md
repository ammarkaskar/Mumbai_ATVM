# Mumbai ATVM Machine (Learning Project)
This project is a **Flutter/Dart learning app** that simulates the experience of using a Mumbai ATVM (Automatic Ticket Vending Machine).  
It works on **DartPad** and in a local Flutter setup.

## âœ¨ Features
- Book tickets between Mumbai suburban stations.
- Choose number of tickets and type (Single / Return).
- Automatic fare calculation based on distance.
- Recharge your balance like a smart card.
- Ticket history log.
- **Styled Ticket Print Screen** with QR placeholder.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals
- Practice Flutter widgets (`Scaffold`, `AppBar`, `BottomNavigationBar`, `Dialog`).
- Understand state management using `setState`.
- Work with lists, maps, and simple business logic in Dart.

## ðŸš€ Running the Project
- Paste `main.dart` into [DartPad](https://dartpad.dev/) and run.
- Or clone locally and run with:
  ```bash
  flutter run
  ```
